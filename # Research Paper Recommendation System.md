 # Research Paper Recommendation System

This repository contains the code for a research paper recommendation system built using Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Plotly. The system allows users to search for research papers by name or ID, and also provides recommendations based on keywords or paper IDs.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you will need the following libraries installed:

* Streamlit
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Plotly

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
```

## Running the Code

To run the code, clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/research-paper-recommendation-system
cd research-paper-recommendation-system
```

Then, run the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the Streamlit app in your default web browser.

## How to Use the App

The app has three main pages:

* **Home:** This page provides a brief introduction to the app.
* **Search by Name:** This page allows you to search for research papers by name.
* **Get Recommendations:** This page allows you to get recommendations for research papers based on keywords or paper IDs.

To search for a research paper by name, simply enter the name of the paper in the text input field and click the "Search" button. The app will then display a table of the top 5 matching papers.

To get recommendations for research papers, you can either enter a keyword or a paper ID in the text input field and click the "Get Recommendations" button. The app will then display a table of the top 5 recommended papers.

## Code Explanation

The code for the app is organized into three main files:

* `app.py`: This file contains the main code for the app. It imports the necessary libraries, loads the data, and defines the functions for searching for and recommending papers.
* `data.py`: This file contains the code for loading and preprocessing the data.
* `utils.py`: This file contains some utility functions that are used by the other files.

### `app.py`

The `app.py` file contains the main code for the app. It imports the necessary libraries, loads the data, and defines the functions for searching for and recommending papers.
